By Keith Ong (keith_ong@u.nus.edu) and Maximus Tan (maximus@u.nus.edu)

## Motivation 

There is an increasing amount of concern over environmental damage that humans are causing over the years. We want to do our part in saving the environment by incentivising users to be more environmentally-friendly through the use of our app. Offering rewards for recycling is a powerful motivator, and we hope to increase participation rates through this incentive.


## Aim 

With growing worries about how humans harm the environment, we want to help by encouraging people to be greener with our app. We're offering rewards for recycling to get more people involved. Our aim is to make a big change in how we all treat the planet, so it stays healthy for years to come. With our app, we hope to encourage users to be greener and create a positive feedback loop where users feel rewarded for their eco-friendly actions.
